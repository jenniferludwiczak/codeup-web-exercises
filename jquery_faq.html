                    <dt>Fact #1</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">Hot Springs remains the smallest national park in the system and the
                            only park located in an urban setting.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #2</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">Mackinac National Park was established in 1875 as a resort island in
                            Lake Huron, Michigan. The park was turned back over to the state in 1895 and became
                            Michigan's first state park.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #3</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">Despite Yellowstone becoming the first national park in 1872, the actual
                            National Park Service wasn't established until 1916, when the government decided there needed
                            to be an autonomous agency to manage the protected land.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #4</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">The parks had many different caretakers before the establishment of the
                            National Park Service, the most prominent being the U.S. Army Cavalry from 1886 to 1916.
                            During this time, the Cavalry introduced the prototype for today's uniforms, the wide-brimmed
                            hat being the most recognizable feature. Rangers today still wear these uniforms in homage to
                            the early protectors of the parks.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #5</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">In 1933, it was decided that the National Park Service should oversee
                            multiple types of federally protected land. This reorganization transferred land from the war
                            department and the forest service over to the NPS, including national monuments, historic sites,
                            battlefields, lakeshores and recreation areas.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #6</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">The national park of American Samoa is the only park in which the U.S.
                            government actually leases the land from local villages on the islands; every 50 years a new
                            contract has to be negotiated.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #7</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">There's been a continual debate regarding the appropriateness of a
                            cafeteria inside Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico (750 feet underground). Many
                            people think the institution goes against the NPS code of keeping the parks natural and
                            limiting in-park commercialism.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt>Fact #8</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">In the early years the NPS did very little to keep bears from obtaining
                            human food. In fact, they encouraged it by setting up viewing areas for visitors to sit and
                            watch the bears riffle through dumpsters. This led to issues of public safety and problematic
                            bears. The picture depicts onlookers at the Adirondack Forest Preserve in 1973.

                            The most disturbing of these stories comes from Glacier National Park; during construction of
                            Going-to-the-Sun Road, deceased horses were thrown over a specific cliff on Saint Mary Lake
                            where grizzlies waited below. Visitors would sit and watch the activity.</dd>

                    <dt>Fact #9</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">Teddy Roosevelt's wife and mother both died on the same day, Valentine's
                            Day of 1884. Because of this, Teddy fled to the badlands of North Dakota, an area where he had
                            once hunted bison. He liked this area because he thought the desolate landscape matched the
                            condition of his heart and thus offered an adequate place to begin the healing process. This
                            area was later named Teddy Roosevelt National Park.</dd>

                    <dt>Fact #10</dt>
                        <dd class="invisible">Park ranger Roy Sullivan was hit by lightning seven times—and survived
                            them all—during the course of his career. He worked at Shenandoah National Park between 1942
                            and 1977. Sullivan claims he was also struck by lightning once as a child, but never
                            officially documented the account. He is reported as saying his first strike in Shenandoah
                            was the most painful.</dd>
